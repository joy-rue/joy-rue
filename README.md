WELCOME TO joy-rue collection of Repos 
I'm an aspiring Software Engineer currently a Senior at Ashesi University finalising my undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
The languages I frenquently use are Python, Django, C and JavaScript, but I am flexible to explore any frameworks as need arises.
My GitHub repositories are a collection of mini-projects I took on to gain an in-depth understanding of Computer Systems and Data Structures while simultaneously improving the existing ones.
Some projects I endervoured independently, focusing on my personal growth, while others involved collaboration with organizations to address problems at a larger-scale.. (Health, Financial, and Educational sector).
I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on tea m coding challenges. If you have a project you would like me contribute to, don't hesistate !✌️
